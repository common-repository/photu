Managing your images and delivering the perfect image, tailored and optimized for your userâ€™s device is, therefore, more critical than it has ever been.

= Does Photu support all image formats? =

Photu supports all popular image formats that cover 99.99% of the use case. On the settings page, you can further configure if you want to allow or disallow a particular file type to be loaded via Photu.

= I installed the plugin, but the Photu website analyzer is suggesting more optimization. =

This is because image dimensions are not as per the layout. We could have done it using Javascript in the frontend like other plugins, but we do not recommend it. The browser triggers the image load as soon as it sees an image URL in HTML and intentionally delaying this while Javascript calculates the ideal width will ultimately slow down the image load for your users.
